The approach taken when creating this Portfolio was to develop the structure first by implementing the html layout of the index html. This started with the creation of the header that is displayed on all pages inside of the Portfolio. Then the footer, which included other ways to contact such as GitHub, LinkedIn or via email. This too was included on every page. Then the center content was information about myself and interests. This was layed out using flexbox, as it makes this easier to move around and align accordingly with justify content, align items, etc. Once the initial page was layed out then the css came in. Designing the initial page was first with the use of a chosen color pallet and the use of border-radius changes and text and box shadowing it came together. Each additional page was also designed with flex box and used the same color pallet.

The carousel of projects as well as the hamburger type icon that forms after the screen size is reduced are the main aspects that include JavaScript/jQuery. The carousel was created with an on click function, for the back and next buttons. Additional coding was used in order to change the destination of the live view and code view buttons depending on the index of the image. The carousel is inside of a conditional that is based on the screens size so that smaller screens it displays all of the projects in a column fashion. The hamburger icon is used for smaller displays as well and in corporates some javascript/jQuery to toggle on and off the class is-active that is defined in the css.

So far, the unresolved issue that is taking place in this Portfolio is the ability to actually submit an email message, it currently just brings you to a thank you page.
